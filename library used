import turtle:
module turtle
Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.

Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an import turtle, give it the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.

By combining together these and similar commands, intricate shapes and pictures can easily be drawn.

This module is an extended reimplementation of turtle.py from the Python standard distribution up to Python 2.5. (See: http://www.python.org)

import time:
module time
This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

There are two standard representations of time. One is the number of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT). It may be an integer or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds). The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970. The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time. The tuple items are:

  year (including century, e.g. 1998)  
  month (1-12)  
  day (1-31)  
  hours (0-23)  
  minutes (0-59)

import random
module random
Random variable generators.

    integers  
    --------  
           uniform within range  

    sequences  
    ---------  
           pick random element  
           pick random sample  
           pick weighted random sample  
           generate random permutation
